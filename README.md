# Hi there, I'm Arnav, welcome to my GitHub page 👋

I am a High School student in my senior year. I am an iOS app developer with an app on the App Store.

## My current projects <br/>

> 🌃 [UnsplashSwiftUI](https://github.com/ArnavMotwani/UnsplashSwiftUI) is a SwiftUI package designed to make fetching and loading images from the Unsplash API simple and efficient.

> ✨ [CircularProgressSwiftUI](https://github.com/ArnavMotwani/CircularProgressSwiftUI) is another SwiftUI package that creates an animated circular progress bar.

> 🗝 [Shortcuts](https://sites.google.com/view/arnavmotwani/shortcuts) is a list of shortcuts I designed for iOS and iPadOS, I use these regularly and i thought others might like them.
