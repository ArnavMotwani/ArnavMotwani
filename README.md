## Projects
### frzn-docs (coming soon)
An AI-powered documentation agent that lets you ask natural-language questions about any GitHub repo. It clones and indexes your code into semantic embeddings and powers a RAG workflow (via LangGraph & OpenAI) to deliver fast, context-aware answers straight from your source.
